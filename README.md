# library-system
Implementing a library system that handles library items. You are expected that you find an Object Oriented Solution to this problem.

Suppose that two kinds of people using library items. These are students and academic stuffs.
Students can borrow only one item at a time, and academic stuffs can borrow at most 3 items
at the same time. Also people that use library items have common properties. For example
everyone has a name, surname and unique number for each person.
At the library we have items and people are allowed to borrow them for a while. We have 3
types of items at the library. Books, Magazines and Compact Discs (CDs). All items have a
unique number called serial number, shelf number that the item put on that shelf and shelf
index, the index of the item at the shelf. Items at the library have additional different
properties changing to item type. For example books have name, publisher name, and author
name. CDs have title property and magazines have name, publisher properties. But people are
allowed to borrow only books and CDs not magazines.
